Practice app.

Based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c4-XJkDqC0


Difficulitesbuild docker-compose app with database - its necessary to kill mysqld process.

Necessary to include:
     volumes:
        - ./mysql/database:/var/lib/mysql
        - ./mysql/dump:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
        
in docker-compose.yml database part.

Docker uses older images even after changes in app and rebuilding docker containers.
Refreshing images before starting app after changes is important.
