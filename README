Practice app.

Difficulitesbuild docker-compose app with database - its necessary to kill mysqld process.

Necessary to include:
     volumes:
        - ./mysql/database:/var/lib/mysql
        - ./mysql/dump:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
        
in docker-compose.yml database part.

Docker uses older versions of created images.
Deleting older images before starting app is important.
